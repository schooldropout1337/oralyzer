The error message indicates that you are encountering a "list index out of range" error in your code. This error occurs when you are trying to access an index that is outside the valid range of the list.

In the specific code snippet you provided, the error is raised in the `fetcher` function at the line:

```python

print(unquote(jsonOutput[output][2]))

```

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Verify that the `jsonOutput` list is not empty. It's possible that the list is empty, which would result in the "list index out of range" error when trying to access elements.

2. Check the structure of the `jsonOutput` list and ensure that it has the expected format. Make sure that the index `[output][2]` exists in the list elements.

3. Confirm that the loop range `range(1, 1000, 1)` is appropriate for the size of the `jsonOutput` list. If the list is smaller than 1000 elements, it will result in an index out of range error.

4. Consider adding additional checks and validations before accessing elements in the `jsonOutput` list to handle cases where the expected structure may not be present.

By reviewing and addressing these points, you should be able to identify and resolve the "list index out of range" error in your code.
